Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Overview
In today's digital world, even small organizations require reliable and secure networks to carry out daily operations.
This project involves designing and simulating a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network using Cisco Packet
Tracer. The network is structured to support three departments — IT, Finance, and Customer Service — by
implementing VLANs for segmentation, router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN communication, and DHCP for automated IP management. The goal is to provide a scalable and secure environment that supports both wired and wireless
connectivity.
1.2 Features
 Departmental Segmentation using VLANs
 Inter-VLAN Communication using sub-interfaces on a single router
 Dynamic IP Addressing using router-based DHCP pools
 Secure Wireless Access with password-protected access points
 Support for Wired and Wireless Devices including PCs, laptops, and smartphones
 Network Simulation and Testing using Cisco Packet Tracer
1.3 Objectives
 To design a scalable network architecture suitable for small businesses
 To segment the network using VLANs for enhanced security and performance
 To enable communication between departments using inter-VLAN routing
 To implement dynamic IP allocation using DHCP
 To integrate wireless networks for mobility and flexibility
 To test the network using simulation tools and validate its performance
Chapter 2: Requirements
2.1 Hardware Requirements
Device Quantity Description
Cisco Router (e.g., 2911) 1 For routing and DHCP server configuration
Cisco Switch (e.g., 2960) 1 Layer 2 switch for VLANs and port assignment
Wireless Access Points 3 One per department (IT, Finance, Customer)
PCs 3 Wired clients representing each department
Smartphones/Laptops 3 Wireless devices representing mobile users
Ethernet Cables As needed For physical connections (straight-through and crossover)
2.2 Software Requirements
 Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.0 or above)
 Operating systems on end devices with support for IP configuration
 Router and switch IOS with support for VLANs, DHCP, and 802.1Q trunking
 GUI access or command-line knowledge for configuration
Chapter 3: Implementation and Result
3.1 Network Design
The network is divided into three subnets, each representing a department. Each department is assigned a VLAN, and
a subnet is allocated using CIDR and subnetting principles. The router interfaces use 802.1Q encapsulation to support multiple VLANs over a single physical interface.
3.2 VLAN and IP Addressing Plan
VLAN Department Subnet Default Gateway IP Range
2 IT 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.62
3 Finance 192.168.1.64/26 192.168.1.65 192.168.1.65 – 192.168.1.126
4 Customer Service 192.168.1.128/26 192.168.1.129 192.168.1.129 – 192.168.1.190
3.3 Switch Configuration
Ports on the switch were manually assigned to their respective VLANs. One port (Fa0/24) was configured as a trunk
port to carry VLAN traffic to the router.
🖥️ PC Configuration (Wired Clients)
We'll assume each PC is connected to a VLAN-assigned port on the switch and will receive its IP from the routerbased DHCP server.
🔹 Step-by-step for each PC:
1. Click on the PC (e.g., PC_IT).
2. Go to Desktop > IP Configuration.
3. Set to DHCP.
Expected IPs (Auto-assigned):
PC VLAN Expected IP Range Gateway
PC_IT 2 192.168.1.2 – .62 192.168.1.1

✅ Simulation and Connectivity Testing Results
The following tests were conducted using Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation Mode and real-time ping tests to verify
the network functionality:
Let's walk through the ping test from Smartphone3 (IP: 192.168.1.133) to Smartphone2 and explain
what should happen, including how to interpret the result.


📊 Result Summary
 Dynamic IP Assignment: All devices (PCs and phones) successfully obtained IP addresses from the correct
DHCP pool.
 Wireless Security: Devices could only connect with correct WPA2-PSK credentials.
 Inter-VLAN Routing: All departments could communicate as required.
 Access Point Connectivity: Each AP was reachable and bridged correctly to VLANs.
 Segmentation: Devices in one VLAN couldn’t access other VLANs unless routing was enabled.
 Ping Tests: Latency was simulated, and all pings returned replies confirming end-to-end communication.
 Visualization: Packet Tracer visually confirmed all packets followed the expected path, respecting VLAN
tagging and trunk links.
